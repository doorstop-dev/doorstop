  This is an example with nesting and empty list items:
  1. Item 1
  1. Item 2
      1. Item 2.1
          1. Item 2.1.1
  1. Item 3

  _Notes_:

  Numered (or **ordered**) lists in Markdown are a bit special.

  They are identified with a number followed immediatly by a . (dot).

  **What** number does not really matter!

  Therefore, the easiest way to make sure **all** differenct markdown renderers
  handles the list correctly is to use the same number for all items in the list,
  i.e., 1.

  The indentation is also important. Whereas the unordered lists can handle
  different indentation, the ordered lists must have four (4) spaces
  indentation for each level!

  _**IMPORTANT**_

  _Ordered lists that are nested in Markdown cannot automatically handle nested numbering!_
  In other words, each nested level **will** start with the number 1!
