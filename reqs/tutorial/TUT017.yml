  #### Heading 4

  ##### Heading 5

  ### Emphasis
  Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

  Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

  Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

  Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

  ### Paragraphs
  When exporting to html using doorstop newlines
  are converted to line breaks.

  An empty line is required to start a new paragraph.

  ### Lists
  1. First ordered list item
  2. Another item
  1. Actual numbers don't matter,
  just that it's a numbers

  * Unordered list can use asterisks
  - Or minuses
  + Or pluses

  ### Tables
  Colons can be used to align columns.

  | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
  | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
  | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
  | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
  | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

  There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
  The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
  raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

  Markdown | Less | Pretty

  *Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
