  This is an example on how to create a list:
  * Item 1
  * Item 2
  * Nested list
    * Item 2.1
    * Item 2.2
    * Deeper nesting
      * Item 2.2.1
      * Item 2.2.2
      * Item 2.2.3
        + Empty
          + Nesting
            * Should work
              - too!

  _Note: The list above is not numbered, and it works with both `*`, `+` and `-`. It also works with two (2) or four (4) space indentation, although you should keep the same indentation in the list._
