# Integrity Checks

To check a document hierarchy for consistency, run the main command:

```sh
$ doorstop
building tree...
loading documents...
validating items...

REQ
│
├── TUT
│   │
│   └── HLT
│
└── LLT
```

By default, the validation run displays messages with a *WARNING* and *ERROR*
level.  In case verbose output is enabled, also messages with an *INFO* level
are shown.  *INFO* level messages are generated under the following conditions:

* Skipped levels within the items of a document.
* No initial review done for an item.
* The prefix of an UID is not equal to the document prefix.
* The prefix of a link UID is not equal to the parent document prefix.

*WARNING* level messages are generated under the following conditions:

* A document contains no items.
* Duplicated levels within the items of a document.
* An item has an empty text attribute.
* An item has unreviewed changes.
* An item is linked to an inactive item.
* An item is linked to a non-normative item.
* An item is linked to itself.
* An item has a suspect linked to an item those fingerprint is not equal to the
  one recorded in the link.
* An item in a document with child documents has no links from an item in one of its child documents.
* A normative, non-derived item in a child document has no links.
* A non-normative items has links.
* There is a cycle of item links.

*ERROR* level messages are generated under the following conditions:

* Link with a invalid UID.
* Unknown item for an UID.
* External reference cannot be found.

## Links

To confirm that every item in a document links to its parents:

```sh
$ doorstop --strict-child-check
building tree...
loading documents...
validating items...
